## About Allor Documentation

This project was created in response to the ever-growing [README.MD](https://github.com/Nourepide/ComfyUI-Allor/blob/main/README.MD) file and the increasing size of the Allor repository due to images.

It was decided to dedicate a separate project solely for documentation.

This also facilitates a more convenient and faster addition/modification of information about Allorâ€™s modules and nodes.

## Building
Allor Documentation is automatically built after each update using GitHub Actions and is deployed on GitHub Pages. 

Manual builds from the terminal/console or in IDEs other than [Writeside](https://www.jetbrains.com/writerside/) are not currently supported.
